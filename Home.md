Release Schedule
----------------

Note: This is all new, so this might be a little rocky for the near future.

The NDK has stable releases on a roughly quarterly basis, with a beta release every month.

The betas serve two purposes: you can let us know early if we've broken your app so we can address the issue before release, and you can verify that the fix for a bug really does solve your problem.

The betas should not be used for production.
